WELCOME TO THE CUSTOM CHUCK NORRIS FACTS SERVICE

I built this to practice a few things I was still a bit hazy on, including but not limited to;

React Flux architecture(completely unnecessary for this project, I just needed the practice)

Forms and how they act in React in respect to STATE and PROPS

Responsive design(still in progress)

How to maintain data through page refreshes(accomplished here through the local storage on the user's device)

API calls

Altering the content of aforementioned API call(in this case, replacing all instances of "Chuck Norris" with whatever the user wants).
